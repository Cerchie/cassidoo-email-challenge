# cassidoo-email-challenge-oct-18-22

Code challenge from Cassidy William's weekly newsletter in Oct 18-22.

To run, `git clone https://github.com/Cerchie/cassidoo-email-challenge.git` and cd in the resultant folder. Then, once you've got [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, run `node solution.js`

This solution doesn't solve for edge cases-- if you have ideas for extending it let me know by submitting an issue!
